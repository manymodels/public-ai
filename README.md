# Welcome to Public AI

This GitHub hosts the website for the Public AI Network. The site itself is deployed using a local fork of jekyll/minima, lightly customized to allow things like custom navbar links. To edit the main front page, go to [https://github.com/manymodels/public-ai/blob/main/index.md](https://github.com/manymodels/public-ai/blob/main/index.md).
