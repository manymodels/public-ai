## A New Role for Libraries in the AI Age

Public libraries have long served as trusted centers for information, learning, and community. Now, they have a chance to become something even more: trusted providers of **public AI**.

The Library of Congress, Metagov, and Public Knowledge, in partnership with the [Utah State Library](https://library.utah.gov/) and the [New Jersey State Library](https://www.njstatelib.org/), are launching a pilot program to bring **community-based AI services** to public libraries across the United States. This is your opportunity to join a national effort to make **AI more accessible and useful for your community.**

## The Library Pilot Program

We are inviting **8-10** libraries across the United States to join the pilot program in 2025-2026. **The program will begin in Fall 2025**.

Each pilot site will receive:
- A **dedicated AI workstation** with open source models, a set of curated AI applications, and a community-specific knowledge interface
- Access to **AI infrastructure** for organizing and localizing community data
- Opportunities to shape the **future of public AI**

Libraries will also participate in storytelling, workshops, and a final presentation to local stakeholders and lawmakers.

## Why Your Library?

- **You're already trusted.** Libraries are among the most respected institutions in the country.
- **You’re already experimenting.** From book club bots to grant-writing help, libraries are exploring how AI can help.
- **You have the skills.** Librarians are information scientists and community leaders—perfectly positioned to steward AI access.
- **You’re everywhere.** Libraries reach every corner of the nation. This is public infrastructure at its finest.

## Get Involved

We’re looking for libraries across **diverse regions and community types**. Ideal pilot libraries are:
- Excited to innovate and serve as AI hubs
- Eager to support community members in accessing new technologies
- Committed to making technology work for everyone

We envision a fast-paced, dynamic program where we iterate and co-design the software in partnership with members of the pilot program. Each applicant team should include one library director who can champion the project and one member of staff who is able to run it and serve as the regular point-of-contact.

**Interested in becoming a pilot site? Want to learn more?**

## What Is Public AI?

Public AI is AI as public infrastructure—like public parks, highways, electricity, and yes, libraries. It's **open, accountable, and sustainably maintained**, with access available to all.
