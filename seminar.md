A research seminar to study public AI and other forms of public interest AI.

## Season 3
Season 3 will start on April 22, 2025. We will survey diverse positions on AI emerging from art, culture, and the creative industries. In particular, we will consider the relationship between AI and the creative industries through four lenses: political power, cultural power, technological power, and economic power. Several spots will be reserved for creative professionals in any medium interested in exploring public AI. If you are interested in joining the seminar, please [apply here](https://forms.gle/1f8fkcCEjEoJF6L78) by April 15, 2025.

- March 5: Synthesis

Over the course of the seminar, we will consider different models of public AI, lessons from both history and from AI, general theories of public investment and of regulation, as well as many different arguments for and against public AI. Four themes will guide our considerations: public benefit, public accountability, market failure, and political narratives.

Organizers: Joshua Tan (Oxford, Metagov), SJ Klein (Berkman, Interlace), Nick Garcia (Public Knowledge)

## Goals
The Public AI Seminar has two parallel objectives:

- To foster an intellectual community capable of describing, guiding, and implementing public AI and other forms of public interest AI.
